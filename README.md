# LoLMasteryToolPresentationVer

A presentation version of the original repo, LoLMasteryTool, which is private.

This repo was created so that I could remove any information that I wished to keep private from within the original repo while being able to show the rest of the code publicly. (Such as information within commits during very early development before I ever intended for this to be shown publicly on my account).

Downloading this version will result in a program that does not run unless the user provides their own Riot API key as the environment variable "turtle".

LoLMasteryTool is an application that can be used to track character progression within a game that is not easy to access during character select, this was originally intended just to be a tool I could use to check a single value that was not visible when I wanted it, and has grown over time to present more useful information as I feel I require it.


# Current features include:
